as a developer or someone working in a group you often start small, often the case w development, agile - tasks.
not so with product management or as an artist with a big vision, start w goals and objectives then break them into smaller tasks,

- how many of you use a map to figure out directions? goal is the location, the tasks & process is how you get there.
- art a hack
    - blog, process
    - pictures
    - trello

- break down games into verbs
    - basketball (me)
    - line wobbler (group)
    - pippin barr - pongs breaksout

Iterative process
“Don't worry about a thing until you have to worry about the thing.
Worrying wastes time and that means less progress. Start with the quickest way to implement and get your point across then iterate. "

- pippen barr
